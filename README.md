# wine-quality-pred

📊 Wine Quality Prediction App

This is a simple Flask web application that predicts wine quality using a pre-trained machine learning model. It provides a form for users to enter wine attributes and returns a predicted quality score.

🚀 Features

Built with Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn.
Dockerized for easy deployment.
Simple and interactive web UI.
Predicts red and white wine quality based on physicochemical inputs.

🐳 Run the App with Docker

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/RCC0149/wine-quality-pred.git
cd wine-quality-pred

2. Build the Docker image

docker build -t wine-quality-pred .

3. Run the container

docker run -p 5000:5000 wine-quality-pred

*Then open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5000*
